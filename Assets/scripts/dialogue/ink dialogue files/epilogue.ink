Phew, finally home. #speaker:you #portrait:you_neutral
Xeno factory reset my games console so it doesn't remember anything.
The reset has deleted the free Cavebuild game though, so I'll have to install it again.
Last time I tried to crack a game, I ended up going on the most exhausting adventure of my life.
I never want to do this again.
I think I will just buy the official game instead, like I was always supposed to.
